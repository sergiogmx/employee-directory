# Code Quality Review

## Instructions

When asked to review code quality for a feature or file:

### Step 1: Read the target code
Read all files in the feature directory indicated by the user.
Identify the key patterns being used (API slices, form handling,
type definitions, component structure).

### Step 2: Verify patterns with Context7
Use Context7 MCP to check the latest documentation for:
- **RTK Query**: endpoint definitions, tag management, mutations
- **React Hook Form**: form setup, validation integration
- **Zod**: schema definitions, resolver patterns

Compare the code's patterns against the latest recommended approaches.

### Step 3: Compare against project standards
Read references/coding-standards.md and verify:
- Architecture layer compliance (domain → data → presentation)
- TypeScript strictness (no `any`, proper generics)
- RTK Query conventions (tagTypes, providesTags/invalidatesTags)
- Form patterns (zodResolver, proper error handling)

### Step 4: Generate structured report
Report findings in this format:

**Feature: [name]**

| Category | Finding | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| [category] | [description] | [icon] |

Status icons:
- Correct / follows standards
- Improvable / could be better
- Deprecated / needs update

Include specific file:line references and suggested fixes for any
issues found.
